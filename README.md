# Bike_Sharing

## Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to examine consumer behaviour for the Citi Bike Cruisin’ bike sharing program in Des Moins. By presenting the information in a digestible manner using the visualizations created in Tableau, it will be easy to properly identify trends and communicate them to the necessary decision makers to secure angel funding.

## Summary

Based on the analysis, it looks like the primary customer base for the bike sharing program are Males who use them for their commutes. If the goal is to generate revenue primarily through tourist interest, the prospects don’t look good. That said, it does not mean that there isn’t an opportunity. 

The heavy usage of the bikes for commutes suggests that this is a very safe investment. Even if tourism does not pull in significant demand, the demand from commuters will likely still be worth the investment.

That said, looking at the subscriber to customer ratio, it looks like most users are long time subscribers -- i.e. not temporary users such as tourist. That said it is important to properly verify this. The subscription _should_ require a home address which can be used to determine the actual tourist population. This will help to establish the true customer base as many may subscribe once while they are in town.

Secondly, it would be interesting to know the number of trips that individuals users take per day and even better is a daily route can be mapped. While the bulk of users tend to be commuters, knowing how often the average commuter checks out a bike would be beneficial when deciding target populations.
